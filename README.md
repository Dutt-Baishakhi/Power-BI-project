# Power-BI-project
 Netflix Data Insights with Power BI &amp; Python!
I recently worked on a Netflix Dashboard using Power BI, where I transformed raw data into actionable insights. The process involved:

✅ Data Cleaning: Used Python (Pandas, NumPy) to handle missing values, standardize formats, and optimize the dataset.
✅ Data Visualization: Leveraged Power BI to create interactive dashboards showcasing trends in content, genres,Shows ,release patterns, and viewer engagement.
✅ Key Insights: Identified content trends, country-specific preferences, and platform growth patterns by releasing year. 
 for This project which helped me sharpen my data cleaning, visualization, and storytelling skills! Excited to take on more data-driven challenges.

📊 Would love to hear your thoughts! Have you worked with Netflix data or built dashboards with Power BI? Let’s connect and discuss!
