# Power-BI-project
 Netflix Data Insights with Power BI &amp; Python!
I recently worked on a Netflix Dashboard using Power BI, where I transformed raw data into actionable insights. The process involved:

âœ… Data Cleaning: Used Python (Pandas, NumPy) to handle missing values, standardize formats, and optimize the dataset.
âœ… Data Visualization: Leveraged Power BI to create interactive dashboards showcasing trends in content, genres,Shows ,release patterns, and viewer engagement.
âœ… Key Insights: Identified content trends, country-specific preferences, and platform growth patterns by releasing year. 
 for This project which helped me sharpen my data cleaning, visualization, and storytelling skills! Excited to take on more data-driven challenges.
